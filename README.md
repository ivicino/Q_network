# Q_network
This repository is where I am putting my work learning about the classic Q_network and Deep_Q_network (DQN), as well as any improvements made on the DQN architecture. 

My goal is to improve the DQN algorithm to be able to learn how to play multiple games, and leverage previously learned environments to solve new environments. I don't know if I will be successful in this challenge, but it is worth trying. If I am successful, you will see my success in subsequent creations, but it will probably be a while.
